# InternshipTasks-Month2
# Project-1 Supermarket Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes supermarket sales data to identify revenue trends, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior. The goal is to extract actionable business insights that support data-driven decision-making in retail operations.

## Business Objectives
- Analyze daily sales patterns
- Identify best-performing product categories
- Study customer spending behavior
- Detect peak sales hours

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactional sales records including product details, customer information, sales amounts, and timestamps.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (date and time extraction)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summary and correlation analysis
- Data visualization

## Key Business Insights
- Sales fluctuate daily, indicating varying customer demand.
- A small number of product lines contribute most of the revenue.
- Member customers have higher average spending than non-members.
- Sales peak during specific hours of the day.

## Recommendations
- Focus promotions on high-performing product categories.
- Strengthen customer loyalty programs.
- Optimize staffing during peak sales hours.
- Introduce time-based offers during off-peak hours.

# Project-2 Student Performance Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The objective is to identify key demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors that influence students’ exam scores and to derive meaningful insights that can support educational decision-making.
This project was completed as Project-2 for Month-2 of a Data Analysis Internship.

## Objectives
* Analyze subject-wise student performance (Math, Reading, Writing)
* Understand the impact of demographic factors such as gender and race/ethnicity
* Evaluate the influence of socio-economic indicators like lunch type and parental education
* Assess the effect of test preparation courses on academic performance
* Generate actionable insights using data visualization and statistical analysis

## Dataset Information
**Source:** Kaggle – *Students Performance in Exams*
**Records:** 1000 students
**Features Include:**
  * Gender
  * Race/Ethnicity
  * Parental Level of Education
  * Lunch Type
  * Test Preparation Course
  * Math Score
  * Reading Score
  * Writing Score
A new feature, **average_score**, was engineered to represent overall student performance.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading & Understanding
2. Data Cleaning & Validation
3. Feature Engineering
4. Univariate Analysis
5. Bivariate Analysis
6. Multivariate Analysis & Correlation
7. Insight Generation
8. Conclusion & Future Scope

## Key Insights
* Students generally perform better in reading and writing than in mathematics.
* Test preparation courses significantly improve student performance across all subjects.
* Female students tend to outperform male students in reading and writing, while males slightly lead in mathematics.
* Students receiving standard lunch perform better than those with free/reduced lunch.
* Higher parental education levels correlate with better student performance.
* Strong positive correlation exists between reading and writing scores.
  
## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that student performance is influenced by a combination of academic preparation, socio-economic background, and parental education. Among all factors, **test preparation emerges as the most impactful controllable variable**, suggesting that targeted academic interventions can substantially improve outcomes and reduce performance gaps.

## Future Scope

* Build predictive machine learning models to forecast student performance
* Incorporate additional features such as attendance and study hours
* Perform clustering to identify learning behavior patterns
* Develop personalized academic recommendation systems
